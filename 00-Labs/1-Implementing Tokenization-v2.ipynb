These tokens can be words, characters, or subwords, making complex text understandable to computers. By dividing text into manageable pieces, tokenizers enable machines to process and analyze human language, powering various language-related applications like translation, sentiment analysis, and chatbots. Essentially, tokenizers bridge the gap between human language and machine understanding.\n","\n","<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n","  <img src=\"https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMSkillsNetwork-AI0205EN-SkillsNetwork/tokenizer.png\" width=\"700px\" alt=\"wizard\">\n","</div>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"64033a32-3d02-49b2-9968-d123f614c966","metadata":{},"source":["# __Table of Contents__\n","\n","<ol>\n","    <li><a href=\"#Objectives\">Objectives</a></li>\n","    <li>\n","        <a href=\"#Setup\">Setup</a>\n","        <ol>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Installing-required-libraries\">Installing required libraries</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Importing-required-libraries\">Importing required libraries</a></li>\n","        </ol>\n","    </li>\n","    <li>\n","        <a href=\"#What-is-a-tokenizer-and-why-do-we-use-it?\">What is a tokenizer and why do we use it?</a>\n","    </li>\n","    <li><a href=\"#Types-of-tokenizer\">Types of tokenizer</a></li>\n","        <ol>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Word-based-tokenizer\">Word-based tokenizer</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Character-based-tokenizer\">Character-based tokenizer</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Subword-based-tokenizer\">Subword-based tokenizer</a></li>\n","                <ol>\n","                    <li><a href=\"#WordPiece\">WordPiece</a></li>\n","                    <li><a href=\"#Unigram-and-SentencePiece\">Unigram and SentencePiece</a></li>\n","                </ol>\n","        </ol>\n","    <li>\n","        <a href=\"#Tokenization-with-PyTorch\">Tokenization with PyTorch</a>\n","    </li>\n","    <li>\n","        <a href=\"#Token-indices\">Token indices</a>\n","        <ol>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Out-of-vocabulary-(OOV)\">Out-of-vocabulary (OOV)</a></li>\n","        </ol>\n","    </li>\n","    <li><a href=\"#Exercise:-Comparative-text-tokenization-and-performance-analysis\">Exercise: Comparative text tokenization and performance analysis</a></li>\n","</ol>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c61d8fdb-f48b-4b67-8ad0-1e712625cf59","metadata":{},"source":["---\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5ccc5851-6f0a-407f-821d-0e9bf3425297","metadata":{},"source":["# Objectives\n","\n","After completing this lab, you will be able to:\n","\n"," - Understand the concept of tokenization and its importance in natural language processing \n"," - Identify and explain word-based, character-based, and subword-based tokenization methods.\n"," - Apply tokenization strategies to preprocess raw textual data before using it in machine learning models.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2b3e0153-3d9a-437b-a3e1-da4fd09e0783","metadata":{},"source":["---\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"7f8a86c8-d722-4f0e-b4ae-74877a535526","metadata":{},"source":["# Setup\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0e81d347-18c6-4254-95e6-569a88327b8f","metadata":{},"source":["For this lab, you will be using the following libraries:\n","\n","* [`nltk`](https://www.nltk.org/) or natural language toolkit, will be employed for data management tasks.
