Amid this treasure trove of information, a monumental task lies ahead: organizing these historical documents into their relevant topic sections. This strategic curation not only promises to enhance the user experience by delivering more streamlined content but also presents an opportunity to breathe new life into invaluable insights from the past through a modern lens. However, the sheer volume and scope of this undertaking call for a sophisticated solution. \n","\n","![Documents Overload](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-GPXX0Y15EN/docs.png)\n","\n","The implementation of an automated machine learning system makes it very efficient. Such a system, equipped with advanced natural language processing and machine learning capabilities, could sift through the vast archives, categorizing articles into their respective topics with remarkable precision. As a result, readers would seamlessly access a wealth of knowledge tailored to their interests, while the editorial team gains newfound agility in content management.\n","\n","In this project, you will embark on the exciting task of classifying news articles for a content search engine. The goal is to build a model that can automatically categorize news articles into different topics or classes, enabling the search engine to deliver relevant content to users efficiently. To achieve this, you will leverage the powerful torchtext library, which simplifies the process of creating a dataset for text classification analysis.\n","\n","With torchtext, you'll have the flexibility to access and preprocess raw news data effortlessly. The library enables you to convert text strings into torch.Tensors, which are essential for training machine learning models. By using torchtext's convenient functionalities, you can set up an efficient data processing pipeline that prepares your text data for classification.\n","\n","Throughout this tutorial, you'll demonstrate how to effectively shuffle and iterate through the processed data using torch.utils.data.DataLoader. This DataLoader simplifies the data handling process, allowing you to focus on building and training your text classification model effectively.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ec112531-f7bd-40e0-a40c-6e530edf4051","metadata":{},"source":["---\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3adf5c66-7dfe-45a7-801c-c8585c92b2c5","metadata":{},"source":["# __Table of Contents__\n","\n","<ol>\n","    <li><a href=\"#Objectives\">Objectives</a></li>\n","    <li>\n","        <a href=\"#Setup\">Setup</a>\n","        <ol>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Installing-required-libraries\">Installing required libraries</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Importing-required-libraries\">Importing required libraries</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Defining-helper-functions\">Defining helper functions</a></li>\n","        </ol>\n","    </li>\n","    <li>\n","        <a href=\"#Text-classification\">Text classification</a></li>\n","        <ol>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Import-bank-data-set\">Import bank dataset</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Data-set\">Dataset</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Data-loader\">Data loader</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Neural-network\">Neural network</a></li>\n","        </ol>\n","    <li><a href=\"#Train-the-model\">Train The model</a></li>\n","    <li><a href=\"#Exercises\">Exercises</a></li>\n","</ol>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2ced23bf-9265-44eb-90a8-035bb89f8028","metadata":{},"source":["# Objectives\n","\n","After completing this lab, you will be able to:\n","\n","- Work with datasets and understand tokenizer, embedding bag technique and vocabulary.\n","- Explore embeddings in PyTorch and understand token indices.\n","- Perform text classification using data loader and apply it on a neural network model.\n","- Train the text classification model on a news dataset.\n","- Engage in various exercises to solidify your understanding.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"98d579a4-0181-43c4-978c-39b63203cbdf","metadata":{},"source":["---\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b1f0d9c6-bf2e-4735-98ea-cfeb94c20c1e","metadata":{},"source":["# Setup\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e2c5bcbc-3454-4640-9ce8-449d35b1c4ff","metadata":{},"source":["For this lab, you will use the following libraries:\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8a9a9c78-d221-481e-b47c-b59f31f27e2c","metadata":{},"source":["### Installing required libraries\n","\n","All the required libraries are pre-installed in the Skills Network Labs environment.
